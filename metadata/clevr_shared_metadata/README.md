This directory contains metadata for creating both questions based on the original CLEVR templates by Justin Johnson, and new questions based on the extended set of templates we generated for this project.
This metadata is constant across particular instances of the dataset.

scenes contains a subset of the symbolic scene graphs in the original dataset.
grouped_scenes contains sets of scenes that all share a class of filterable object, making it easier to generate new questions that begin with a filtering node.
